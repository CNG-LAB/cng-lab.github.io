<section class="some-related-articles" id="about">
  <h1 align="left">Team work makes the dream work</h1>
      <p align="left">We highly value collaboration and team science, as we think this is the best way to move ideas forward and conquer interdisciplinary questions with multimodal methods in meaningful way. We believe that both our mistakes and failed attemps, next to hopefully novel discoveries, can help others.
      </p>
      <p align="left"> Below you find certain core values and ideas we believe can help. This section is inspired by the website of <a href="https://www.krienenlab.org/philosophy">Fenna Krienen</a>.
      </p>
  </br>
  <h1 align="left">Values and expectations</h1>
      <h2 align="left">Asking questions</h2><p align="left">We believe that asking questions and questioning ideas is important. Therefor we recommend and practise asking questions whenever the oppertunity arises.
      </p>
      <h2  align="left">Exchange</h2><p align="left">As our lab is based in two institutes, (online) communication is key. We have regular sprints with the lab, and weekly group meetings and other meetings during the week.
      </p>
      <h2 align="left">Initiative</h2><p align="left">Though scientific practise is team-work, we believe self-initiative is part of the fun. I am honored to provide a place and broad idea for projects, I expect you to develop your own ideas and thoughts with my help.
      </p>
      <h2 align="left">Open science</h2><p align="left">Science is to be shared, and sometimes two lines of code say more than a 1000 words. We try to make our code, maps and papers openly accessable, and are part of open science initiative at the Max Planck Institute.
      </p>
      <h2 align="left">Pay it forward</h2><p align="left">Learning is not only about receiving but also about giving back. Learn to transfer your skills and help and teach others in the lab and beyond and take pride in their success.
      </p>
      <h2 align="left">Respect</h2><p align="left">Please be considerate and respect each other in and outside of the lab. Life and work can be stressful, but acknowledge others for their support. Please be kind to yourself and others.
      </p>
  </br>
  <h1 align="left">My role</h1>
      <p align="left">I am there to help and support you and your science (but I don't have all the answers).
      </p>
      <p align="left">You can expect me to uphold the labs values. I'll do my very best to make your time in my group a valuable learning experience where you feel safe, can have fun, and can grow as a scientist.
      </p>
