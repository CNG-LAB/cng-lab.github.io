  <h1>Our questions & how and why we try to answer them</h1>
  </br>
  </br>
  <p align="center"> The ultimate goal of our research is to understand the biological scaffolds of human thought and feelings. Within this context we are particularly interested to
  understand how heritable factors constrain human brain organization enabling human
  cognition and how social-environmental factors interact with this neurogenetic
  scaffold. A more short-term goal is to contribute to meaningful projects and help members of our lab develop, learn new skills, and gain insights into the human brain.
  </br>
  </br>
  We integrate approaches using multi-level approaches, from genes to cognition, with a focus on neuroimaging. Specifically; we want to understand how heritable factors systematically shape neuroanatomy and organize the human brain, enabling it to suppport human cognition. To reach this goal, we combine approaches from behavioral genetics, neuroimaging, neuroanatomy, phylogenetic models, and transcriptomics. Ultimately, our maps may be applied to clinical context, helping to understand the neurogenetic basis of brain disorders. Moreover, we want to understand how to 'nurture' brain structure, function and associated behaviors. To answer this question, we use cross-sectional, longitudinal, and developmental multimodal neuroimaging and behavioral datasets to study the interplay between the (social) environment, behavior and brain organization. Ultimately, Sofie's goal is to understand the biological scaffolds of human thought and feelings.

          <h2> Axes of human brain organization </h2> <p align="left">
          What are the scaffolds of human cognition? We have been able to establish a link between the macroscale cortical axes recounting the genetic correlation between brain regions and phylogenetic models of cortical expansion and the dual origin model in humans and macaques. Such axes may provide a coordinate system along which brain development and function can be understood. </p>

          <h2> Multilevel approaches </h2> <p align="left">
          How do evolution, heritable factors, brain structure, brain function and behavior interrelate? Using computational and data-driven approaches we hope to gain further understanding into different explanatory levels into the biological basis of human thought. Usually we do this through combining multiple neuroimaging modalities with genetic information, for example using twin-models, and/or behavioral markers.

          <p align="left"> We are integrating our models of brain organization with maps of disorder impact to further understand how brain structure and function may provide biological axes in which disorders are embedded. Such insights may provide insights into the nosology of mental health and disease.</p>
